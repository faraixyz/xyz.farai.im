I'm on record saying that [<cite>The Onion</cite> made great videos](/the-classics/micro/onions-great-videos.md) and I'm pleased to say they're back to having their old momentum given how they've brought back The Onion News Network. It turns out that Jeff Lawson, founder of Twillio, bought <cite>The Onion</cite>. A strange purchase and an uphill battle to make profitable media, but I wish him and <cite>The Onion</cite> team success!

Here's a fun video on how they're *still* waiting to know which minority to scapegoat for the election results.
