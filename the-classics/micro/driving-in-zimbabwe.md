Now, [I've complained](/the-classics/blog/shit-zim-drivers.md) about [Zimbabwean drivers](/the-classics/blog/zimbos-drive-better.md) a lot on this site and I guess the problem isn't so much as Zim drivers as it is me not understanding the rules of the road. In this post, Ranga provides some useful tips on how to navigate Zimbabwean roads. Tips include, speeding, overtake when you feel like it as people will make space for you, tailgate and see traffic lights as a suggestions.

If this strategy were to fail, blame exploding goblins and bad roads <q>even when you crash on a good stretch of highway</q>.
