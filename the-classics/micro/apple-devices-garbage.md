[Apple has decided to split iTunes into 3 different apps](https://support.apple.com/guide/itunes/how-itunes-is-changing-itns5ecc4f3c/windows) on Windows where:

* iTunes will be for Podcasts and audiobooks,
* Apple Music for Music,
* Apple TV for movies and TV, and
* Apple Devices to transfer files.

I don't have a MacBook so I relied on iTunes to transfer files onto it since Apple refuses to implement a sensible file system. Yes there's SMB support and USB-C but those shouldn't be necessary to do basic shit like this. Not that iTunes was a great file transfer experience before but Apple Devices is so much worse. I wanted to copy over some videos I downloaded and these are the issues I had:

* it refuses to copy WebMs even though it shouldn't matter to the app I'm copying it to,
* there is no progress indicator so I can't tell the progress of file transfers, and
* it somehow doesn't have an "Apply to All" for resolving duplicates.

It's impressive how a multi trillion dollar company can make software so bad. Just use [CopyTrans](https://www.copytrans.net/) until Apple sorts this shit out.
