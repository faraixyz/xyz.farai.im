title: Can I Fix This Wifi/Bluetooth Interference With Software Only?

One thing that has annoyed me about my new laptop is that my otherwise lovley MX Master is very choppy when I use Bluetoothâ€”something that was never a problem on my old laptop. This means that I have to use the receiver, which I've lost although [it was dying anyway](/the-classics/micro/logitech-receiver-dying.md).

It wasn't until I reconfigured my laptop that noticed that the mouse works perfectly fine with bluetooth and the issue is that the network chip is causing the Bluetooth/WiFi interference which made the mouse choppy. The whole "turn off the battery saving" setting doesn't work.

If anyone's reading this, is there a way to fix this **with software only**? I'm not in a position to replace the network card right now.
