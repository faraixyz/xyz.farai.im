I was roaming the internet when I shouldn't have and I discovered this post on Sister Gertrude, a nun from Maredret Abbey who makes beer to fundraise for their convent. It's a beautiful story where women, no less religious ones, smash the patriarchy and [make some beer like they used to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_brewing)[^beer].

Just one problem... I won't spoil it here but here's a clue. The nun behind the project, Sister Gertrude Consolata Mukangano, is [a Rwandian refugee](https://thegreatlakeseye.com/post?s=Of--a--G%C3%A9nocidaire--nun--making--millions--from--beer_781). The story didn't get as much traction as I thought it did but it's strange how <cite>Reuters</cite>, <cite>Voice of America</cite>, <cite>Insider Edition</cite> and even their own brewers failed to conduct a single Google search. Funnily [a trade magazine](https://www.inside.beer/news/detail/belgium-has-a-new-abbey-beer/) actually did do a Google search.

[^beer]: I was trying to find something to link to, but the top articles have to do with how witchhunts put an end to [the foolishness of female brewers](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/women-used-dominate-beer-industry-until-witch-accusations-started-pouring-180977171/). Turns out [that isn't true](https://braciatrix.com/2017/10/27/nope-medieval-alewives-arent-the-archetype-for-the-modern-pop-culture-witch/).
