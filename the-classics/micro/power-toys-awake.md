The other day, I noticed a stange icon in the system tray that looked like a teacup ![](/images/awake-icon.png '{"style":"display:inline;height:1em; width: auto;"}') that was called "Awake". Turns out it's part of the [PowerToys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) suite of utilities which I only use for the Spotlight-like search bar. Reading about [Awake](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/awake) some more, it turns out it's designed to keep your laptop...awake without changing you're system's power settings, useful when you're doing long running tasks.

One thing I was annoyed with when I got [my new laptop](/the-classics/blog/my-new-laptop.md) was how the laptop would go to sleep and killdoing a long running tasks like compiling and using ffmpeg. It wasn't a problem before since my old laptop had no battery so staying on was the default. Now I know this exists, I'm going to use it more often.
