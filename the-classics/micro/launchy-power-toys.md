I use a program called [Power Toys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) which adds a lot of useful features to Windows, like [keeping your computer awake](/the-classics/micro/power-toys-awake.md).

The feature I use most is PowerToys Run which is like Spotlight search for Windows where you click <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> and get a search bar.

At work, I occassionally access the server via Remote Desktop. <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> is muscle memory at this point until I stopped and thought:

> Wait, why does <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> work even though I haven't installed PowerToys?

Turns out that the server installed an application called [Launchy](https://www.launchy.net/), which probably inspired Microsoft to Sherlock the feature.

Like I said, PowerToys has a lot of great features which I'll write about at some point.
