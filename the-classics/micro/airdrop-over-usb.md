Today I discovered that AirDrop works through a direct USB connection.

I had to move files off of my iPhone to my iPad so I could transfer them onto my PC since Apple Files is garbage. I tried AirDrop and it was taking forever. In desperation, I wondered if I could use my Lightning to USB-C cable to connect my iPad to the iPhone and it worked!

When you connect the two you'll get something like "Using Wired Connection" which isn't the Air but I'll take it.
