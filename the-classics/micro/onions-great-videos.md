I've really enjoyed the Onion's backlog of YouTube videos stretching all the way back to 2008. The older stuff is still funny those many years on.

I'll write more on this at some point but I like these ones:

* [Al Quaeda representative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_OIXfkXEj0),
* [Autistic reporter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb5rHthCXoA),
* [some sus self-help advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PC8Luqiws) (maybe Kanye took it?), and
* a discussion as to [whether schizophrenics are being spied on enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzoXQKumgCw)

There's a lot more but it's a glorious channel.
