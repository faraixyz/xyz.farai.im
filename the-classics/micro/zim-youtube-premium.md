I was using YouTube logged out and I noticed an ad for Youtube Premium.

Seemed strange since I thought Zim doesn't have Youtube Premium but it turns out it has it now for $3.50/month. I wish there was an annual plan since all the local prepaid visa cards charge at least $1/transaction.

I guess I have to buy it now after all that time arguing that I would were it available in Zimbabwe.
