I heard about this on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39928950).

I didn't know it was a thing but since it's the 4th of Aprilâ€”that is 4/04 or 4/04 for Americans, I guess it's a good time to add [my 404 page](/404.html '{"noRef": true}') which I tried to make somewhat functional. It has links to internet archives with my old posts, a search link and an email address to let me know what's wrong.
