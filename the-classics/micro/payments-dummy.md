*Me*: Finally, I can start working on integrating this payment gateway

*Me, 3 hours later*: Wait, why the fuck isn't this working?

*Gateway documentation*: HTML form **following the [gateways'] specs**

*Me*: 🤦🏾‍♂️

I eventually figured it out but it turns out that there's a lot of work needed to get the payment's page up and running. Making things worse is that I got another payment gateway that the company has to use. Not sure how I can work with them both...
