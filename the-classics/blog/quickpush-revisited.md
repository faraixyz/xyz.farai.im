QuickPush was the first big project I ever made. I made it over a Christmas break while I was stuck on campus using my then recently acquired laptop. QuickPush was a chrome extension which searched for music on Spotify. I made it because I enjoyed trap music and I wanted to save the good trap songs I would come across listening to YouTube[^1]. 

I don't really have much to say about it since I wrote a [technical blog post about it](/the-classics/blog/quickpush.md)[^2], but I remember it being a lot of fun to make. It integrated cool things like a reactive search and it allowed a user to demo a track. I pushed myself into making something cool. I even paid $5 to publish it and had big plans to add features such as integrating Soundcloud and adding the discovered song into the user's library. 

It doesn't work now because Spotify changed their API but once I was done with it, but it was great while it lasted. As for the entire premise of the extension? Turns out that the cool trap music I enjoyed is difficult to publish independently. Thanks copyright law! 

[^1]: YouTube had all the good trap music.
[^2]: I thought I had deleted it but I found it lying around on my external hard drive. That post was my first technical blog post.
