description: You have no idea how many times I've made the same project over an over again. I'm sick of it so I'm going to make it up as I go.

This is supposed to be an introductory post, much like the one the post [console.log("Hello World")](http://web.archive.org/web/20160716060004/https://agckb.wordpress.com/2015/09/11/hello-world/) I wrote on my very first blog 5 years ago. Much has happened since thenâ€“some positive but mostly negative. In short, **while I have a Computer Science degree, I don't have much to show for it**.

To actually have something to show, I thought I would make a log of programming projects and technical content, but I always got hung up on how it wouldn't be any good. They probably weren't but I could have fixed them into something that was. Instead I opted to keep remaking the same project over and over again, disappointed at how bad I was.

I can't keep doing that so I won't; I'm going to figure things out as I go. Sure I'll make mistakes, and there will always be a better way to do something so I might as well embrace the suck for the sake of my future self. My past self failed to do that and I'm paying for it now. Nice thing is that payment isn't towards some intangible debt collector, but to my future self.

## What I'm Working On Right Now

At the time of writing this, I'm going on in on this iteration of codelab.farai.xyz, building it such that it encourages me to share rather than wait for perfection. Sure my future self will deal with that, but he'll have something to work with unlike now. I also have many posts I've drafted that I've wanted to publish (after editing).

Some of those posts will instead go on my personal website and the Codelab's knowledge base.

~~Projects wise, I have many projects planned but I'm working on Zimbabwe COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker.~~

As soon as I'm done writing this, I'll put in as little effot as possible into making this site availible online. Once it is, I'll focus on building it out properly. If you want to follow me on my journey and feel like helping me out, [support me](/content/support.md).
