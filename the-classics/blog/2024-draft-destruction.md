title: 2024 Is The Year I Destroy My Drafts

Over the years I've written tens of thousands of words most of which I've never published for one reason or another. Whether it's because the idea is worse written down than it is in my head, the post needs more work or I was just too lazy to publish it, they've been gathering dust in my hard drive[^dust].

Heck, [I've written about this before](/the-classics/blog/im-not-ready.md) at a time when I had just 83 unpublished posts—it's at least 200 now[^drafts].

I started out wanting to do a "100 Days of Blogging" type thing but given all the drafts I have, I'll probably run into [NaBloPoMo](https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/nablopomo-2023-day-1/) in November, [Blogging Advent](https://jamesg.blog/2021/12/01/advent-of-bloggers-1/) in December and even [Bloganuary](https://bloganuary.wordpress.com/) in January 2025!

Expect a post here everyday until my drafts folder has been emptied out. Those drafts will fall under the [Draft Destruction tag](/content/tags/draft-destruction/_index.md). This used to be 'Old Drafts' of [From the Drafts](/content/tags/from-the-drafts/_index.md) but I abandoned that at temp so I hope this sticks. I'll be scheduling them every day each morning and if a new idea pops up I'll push an old draft back.

## Why Though?

I don't know.

I'd like to say that I'll get popular in doing this and I'll get money eventually but that hasn't happened yet. I'd also like to say I'm being helpful or I'll be able to get help since <q cite="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query">a blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox</q> as [Henrik says](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query). Sadly, nobody reads this site so that's unlikely.

The two good reasons I have to do this are that:

1. I want to get rid of all of these markdown files, and
2. I want to focus on other things instead of making this website over and over again.

[^dust]: I doubt this analogy holds. I use SSDs so I guess the right analogy would be gathering stray electrons? IDK man...
[^drafts]: It says 866 but it's actually a quarter of that—the inner folder has a lot of duplicates, triplicates and quadruplates.
