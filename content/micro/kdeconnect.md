AirDrop lets you transfer files between devices over WiFi (and even via USB). It's a nice feature but it's only limited to Apple's iThings.

Thankfully [KDEConnect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) exists which is not only cross-platform, but it comes with other features like sharing the clipboard, controlling a remote device, and getting notifications. 

Wow, having written that out, I forgot that Apple can do these things too through [Handoff](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102426). Still, Handoff isn't cross-platform.
