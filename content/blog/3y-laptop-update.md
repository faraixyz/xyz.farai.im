Three years ago I got [a new laptop](/the-classics/blog/my-new-laptop.md), the HP Pavillion x360 14, and it's been fine. I wish I had the choice, but the 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM and 11th Gen i5 are good enough. My main complaints are:

* The battery life sucks,
* no backlit keyboard (unlike the previous laptop),
* [the bluetooth sucks](the-classics\micro\logitech-receiver-dying.md),
* you have to remove the rubber feet to repair the laptop and
* bad heat management and thermal throttling.

Besides these issues, the laptop is fine. I'm annoyed that I have to use it at once where they aren't paying me for using it, but it is what it is. I can't afford a new laptop right now but if you wanna send me some money, email me at <mailto:gandiyafarai@gmail.com>, lol. I do wish I could get more RAM, storage and Thunderbolt ports.

The SSD went bust a few months ago and thankfully I had just backed it up before it happened. Also, a lot of screws went missing so the bottom is rather flappy. It's rare but it sometimes dies and refuses to wake up unless you reconnect the battery. It happened when I went to Vietnam and thankfully the repair shop did it for free.

As for what I put on it, read [My Laptop Setup](/content/blog/my-laptop-setup.md). I just reinstalled my laptp again so expect the post to be updated quite a bit.
