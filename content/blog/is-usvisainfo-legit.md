So I heard there was a new US visa form and I decided to check for myself. I looked at [my country's embassy's website](https://zw.usembassy.gov/enhancements-to-the-nonimmigrant-visa-appointment-scheduling-process/) and it seems that they did move the form over to <https://ais.usvisa-info.com>, along with the ability to pay online.

Although it's on their site, it seemed sketch so I tried to find the domain among [the list of non .gov addresses belonging to a US government agency](https://github.com/GSA/govt-urls/) and didn't find it so I submitted a [report](https://search.gov/about/policy/govt-urls.html#fba-form-title-3ff8b6de).

I then tried to Google the domain to see if something turns up and it's referenced by the US State Department's website, [Cameroon's US embassy's Facebook page](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=959989476167794&id=100064702509561) and [Guatemala's US embassy's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=503846852565299 '{"hreflang": "sp"}') so I guess it's legit.

From the [FAQs](https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-zw/niv/information/faqs#site_purpose:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20State%20has%20contracted%20GDIT%20to%20provide%20all%20or%20some%20of%20the%20following%20nonimmigrant%20visa%20services%20for%20Zimbabwe):

> The U.S. Department of State has contracted GDIT to provide all or some of the following nonimmigrant visa services for Zimbabwe...
> 
> GDIT is the only entity authorized to provide these services in this country on behalf of the U.S Department of State

Said GDIT (General Dynamics Information Technology) is a big US government contractor, scooping up US$20 billion in US government contracts in 2019. More relevant to this is that the [US State Department gave GDIT $10 billion](https://www.state.gov/u-s-department-of-state-launches-multi-billion-dollar-evolve-acquisition-to-modernize-u-s-diplomatic-technology/) to do all of this.

So there you have it, the domain's legit. Man I spent far too much time on this, I'm gonna sleep.
