This site was made possible by the following:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (with the help of Dart Sass) is what I use to build my static site.
* [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com) for providing the tasty monospace font you're looking at. It's a bold choice but I like it.
* [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) for hosting my site.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) for hosting [this site's source code](https://github.com/faraixyz/xyz.farai.im) as well as for the CI pipeline through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
